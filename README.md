# Key Systems Simulation

This project simulates the addition, usage, and deletion of key systems. The goal is to demonstrate how a system can manage keys, including their creation, usage tracking, and eventual removal from the system.

## Overview

The Key Systems Simulation provides a framework for managing keys in a simulated environment. Users can add new keys to the system, utilize them for specific operations, and delete them when they are no longer needed. This project serves as a basic demonstration of key management and system operations.

## Features

- **Key Addition**: Users can create new keys and add them to the system.
- **Key Usage**: Users can simulate operations using the added keys.
- **Key Deletion**: Users can delete keys from the system when they are no longer required.
- **Data Tracking**: Keeps track of key usage history and states.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C++ (or any other language used)
- **Data Structures**: Utilizes appropriate data structures to manage keys efficiently.
